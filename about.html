      <h2>The purpose of Cosmic Harmonium</h2>
      <p>
        Cosmic Harmonium invites us to recognize the world of form, identity,
        and narrative as Māyā (the material world)— not unreal, but not what it
        seems to be. By shining light (our conciousness) into this present
        moment and see what is real. Eckhart Tolle wrote in The Power Now- true
        life is found in couscious presence, not in mental constructs of past or
        future. As our dear friend Ilona Ciunaite once said the mind is
        hijacking the experience. Heaven, Nirvanna, Shambhala all represent the
        same state of being, which is recgonizing the present moment as the
        divine perfect that it is. For those that have eyes to see, let them
        see.
      </p>

      <h2>Art: a Spiritual Extension of the Self</h2>
      <p>
        Artists often describe their creative process as a form of communion
        with something greater than themselves. Artist Javier Loredo’s “The
        being within” series portrays the human body as a luminous vessel of
        consciousness, inviting all that are welling to see, to look within and
        recognize the light, love, and life as who we are. Similarly, Laura
        Pupo’s work explores the relationship between the inner world of the
        soul and natures external world(Maya), she shows us how the external
        world mirrors the internal world. As above so below, as within so
        without.
      </p>

      <h2>How can I see the Perfection of this everlasting Moment?</h2>
      <p>
        First by silencing all thought over and over again, until it becomes
        natural to you again. I say again because this is our natural state of
        being. We were born internally silent and now we are becoming aware and
        moving back to our natural state of internal silence. Life is not lived
        through thinking it is lived through experiencing/feeling.
      </p>

      <h2>Universal Laws</h2>
      <p>
        Another way to see the perfection of this moment is to start learning
        about the the heremetic laws. By learning about these universal laws you
        embark on a journey of self discovery which in turn is full comprhension
        of this life. By understanding yourself you simultaniously understand
        all that is. This world is divine perfection as is, and it is so due to
        these heremtic laws. There is a natural justice system that is part of
        all of creation. The golden rule "do to others as you would want done to
        you", because it is you. When you hurt someone or smile at someone you
        are returning the perfectly mirrored energetic movement back to you.
        This shows the law of vibration and correspondence. (Throat Chakra and
        Third Eye Chakra) Everything is energy and it flows through everything
        we see. What ever you are vibrating is the energy that is attracted
        (brought back) to you, so the circumstances you find yourself in are in
        energetic harmony with your internal state of vibration. In this way we
        can see how perfect this existence is. There is much much more that goes
        in to the hermetic laws and I do plan on making a podcast about these
        laws, but for now just start to learn what you can from other sources
        and be aware that all 7 universal laws are symbolized internally as our
        chakras. All 7 laws have their own understanding but they all happen
        simultaneously. There is only one after all, but humanity has been given
        7 to be able to break down and understand intellectually who we are.
        Even tho who we are is beyond all understanding, there is a place for
        the intellect and it is very important to study and prepare ourselves
        for the unvieling.
      </p>

      <h2>Art as a Collective Creation</h2>
      <p>
        We (all beings) act as vessels for universal energies to create through
        us. This perspective sees the artist as a conduit through which the
        collective spirit expresses itself. As Larry Culliford notes, “Art forms
        a priceless living bridge between the everyday psychology of our minds
        and the universal spirit of humanity”
      </p>
      <h2>Sharing Art in the Digital Age</h2>
      <p>
        In today's interconnected world, the internet serves as a powerful
        platform to share spiritually infused art. Websites and online galleries
        allow artists to reach audiences across the globe, fostering a sense of
        unity and shared experience. This digital accessibility aligns with your
        intention to make art available to everyone, reflecting the universal
        nature of creativity. If you're interested in exploring more about
        spiritual art or connecting with like-minded people, feel free to ask.
