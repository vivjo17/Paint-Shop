        Cosmic Harmonium invites us to recognize the world of form, identity,
        and narrative as Māyā (the material world)— not unreal, but not what it
        seems to be. By shining light (our conciousness) into this present
        moment to see what is real. Eckhart Tolle wrote in The Power Now- true
        life is found in couscious presence, not in mental constructs of past or
        future. As our dear friend Ilona Ciunaite once said the mind is
        hijacking the experience. Heaven, Nirvanna, Shambhala all represent the
        same state of being, which is recgonizing the present moment as the
        divine perfect that it is. For those that have eyes to see, let them
        see. Artists often describe their creative process as a form of
        communion with something greater than themselves. Artist Javier Loredo’s
        “The being within” series portrays the human body as a luminous vessel
        of consciousness, inviting all that are welling to see, to look within
        and recognize the light, love, and life as who we are. Similarly, Laura
        Pupo’s work explores the relationship between the inner world of the
        soul and natures external world(Maya), she shows us how the external
        world mirrors the internal world. As above so below, as within so
        without. We (all beings) act as vessels for universal energies to create
        through us. This perspective sees the artist as a conduit through which
        the collective spirit expresses itself. As Larry Culliford notes, “Art
        forms a priceless living bridge between the everyday psychology of our
        minds and the universal spirit of humanity” In today's interconnected
        world, the internet serves as a powerful platform to share spiritually
        infused art. Websites and online galleries allow artists to reach
        audiences across the globe, fostering a sense of unity and shared
        experience. This digital accessibility aligns with your intention to
        make art available to everyone, reflecting the universal nature of
        creativity. If you're interested in exploring more about spiritual art
